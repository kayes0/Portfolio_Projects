This project showcases a variety of SQL techniques that are essential for real-world data cleaning and transformation:



\- Data Type Standardization

\- Handling Missing Data

\- Joins for Data Imputation

\- String Manipulation (SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, PARSENAME)

\- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

\- Window Functions (ROW\_NUMBER)

\- Conditional Updates (CASE)

\- Data Normalization

\- Removing Duplicates
