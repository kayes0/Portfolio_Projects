\# Dataset

The data used in this project comes from Our World in Data (OWID), a reputable open dataset that provides daily COVID-19 updates worldwide.

This project showcases a variety of SQL techniques that are essential for real-world data analysis:



\- Data Exploration

\- Aggregation

\- Joins

\- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

\- Window Functions
